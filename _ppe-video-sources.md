> Use [alternatives to N95 respirators [pdf]](http://web.archive.org/web/20200305050924/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandingDifference3-508.pdf) where feasible. These include other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the [certified equipment list](http://web.archive.org/web/20200302172659/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html) identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators.

> The attached filtering cartridge(s) is replaceable and can be easily changed (Bessesen et al., 2015). This makes the device valuable during times of high demand, such as during a pandemic.

1. [New study an eye-opener on how coronavirus is spreading and how little we know](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/08/health/coronavirus-hospital-infections-frieden/index.html), Dr. Tom Frieden, _CNN_, 2020-02-08
 > In health care settings, safely reusable respiratory protection that can be disinfected can be crucially important. Useful products include personal air-purifying devices and elastomeric respirators.
2. [Former CDC director: A coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. What now?](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-pandemic-frieden/index.html), Dr. Tom Frieden, _CNN_, 2020-02-25
> For health care workers, newer, longer-lasting technologies such as elastomeric and positive air pressure respirators could address an otherwise inevitable shortage of medical masks.
3. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1242972789860118528), 2020-03-25
> Elastomeric half-mask N95 respirators are potentially VERY important to protect health care workers. They can be disinfected between uses, & reused safely. How many can be made available, how quickly, with approrpiate cartridges and disinfection supplies? https://bit.ly/3bsbrcZ

From conclusion:
> EFMs have an extremely low failure rate. Physicians are able to assess the adequacy of fit and accurately choose EFM size.

From Results:
> Within 1 month, we were able to reduce the number of N95s needed by our network by 95%. We also found that the cost was, conservatively, 10 times less per month than purchasing disposable N95s, and the cost benefit increases the longer they are needed.
