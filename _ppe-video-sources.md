1. [Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies](http://web.archive.org/web/20200302172659/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/conventional-capacity-strategies.html), archived 2020-03-02 
> Use [alternatives to N95 respirators [pdf]](http://web.archive.org/web/20200305050924/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandingDifference3-508.pdf) where feasible. These include other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the [certified equipment list](http://web.archive.org/web/20200302172659/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html) identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators. 
2. CDC NIOSH Science Blog: [Understanding respiratory protection options in Healthcare: The Overlooked Elastomeric](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/07/06/elastomerics/), Michael Bach, PhD, RN; originally published 2017-07-06
> The attached filtering cartridge(s) is replaceable and can be easily changed (Bessesen et al., 2015). This makes the device valuable during times of high demand, such as during a pandemic.

### Tom Frieden, former CDC director

1. [New study an eye-opener on how coronavirus is spreading and how little we know](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/08/health/coronavirus-hospital-infections-frieden/index.html), Dr. Tom Frieden, _CNN_, 2020-02-08
 > In health care settings, safely reusable respiratory protection that can be disinfected can be crucially important. Useful products include personal air-purifying devices and elastomeric respirators.
2. [Former CDC director: A coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. What now?](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-pandemic-frieden/index.html), Dr. Tom Frieden, _CNN_, 2020-02-25
> For health care workers, newer, longer-lasting technologies such as elastomeric and positive air pressure respirators could address an otherwise inevitable shortage of medical masks.
3. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1242972789860118528), 2020-03-25
> Elastomeric half-mask N95 respirators are potentially VERY important to protect health care workers. They can be disinfected between uses, & reused safely. How many can be made available, how quickly, with approrpiate cartridges and disinfection supplies? https://bit.ly/3bsbrcZ
