These include other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the [certified equipment list](http://web.archive.org/web/20200302172659/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html) identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators.

> The attached filtering cartridge(s) is replaceable and can be easily changed (Bessesen et al., 2015). This makes the device valuable during times of high demand, such as during a pandemic.
